No, I just refuse to believe my eyes
In front of me, something I can't recognize
You stood beside me all my life
The heart machines are ticking
I can hear the life support pumping
The line between life and death doesn't come any clearer than this
Covered with an oxygen mask, these words will be his last
With the energy he's got left, he turns to me and says:
[Chorus]
I cannot stand by you 'til the end of the world
Like I said I would do
No, I won't be able to help you carry the weight of the world
My time has come

Silent as a butterfly, I'll be flying beside you, watching above you
Silent as a butterfly
